                <p>Ruby's on its way out (or so we think), Swift's on its way in (if Apple has its way), and a solar flare could knock out our electricity grid worldwide for weeks. We'll contemplate the (in)significance of these two communities and evaluate our own place in the programming universe.</p>

              <p class='abstract'>
                <p>Starting to contribute to open source can be overwhelming. The tips in this workshop will help you find a path to contributing with less anxiety and confusion. Not sure what project to contribute to? Examine the OSS projects you use for recent activity, small open issues, and friendly maintainers. Not sure what to work on? Documentation, tests, and bug triaging are important contributions to open source that are much appreciated, often overlooked, and usually smaller in scope than a code change. Learn about Pull Request etiquette, what happens after you send in your work, and what it's like in a maintainer's shoes to take the mystery out of the process. Help make the open source world a better place!</p>

                <p>Chris has been writing code professionally for 12 years in the healthcare and education industries using C#, Ruby, and JavaScript. He currently works at Think Through Math where he builds a product that helps more than 3,000,000 kids get better at math. At home, he tries to fend off his four cats while he hacks on projects in Node, Elixir, and Go. His cats usually win.</p>

              <h2 class='talk-title'>What .NET can Learn from Ruby (and vice versa.)</h2>
              <p class='abstract'>
                <p>C# and Ruby are both great languages for building applications. The two are different in many ways, but Chris will argue that the experience of writing, testing, and shipping software in either is not a fundamentally different experience. You'll hear about his time developing software in both languages, and he'll share some of the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. Moreover, Chris will show that the two communities have a lot to learn from each other, and that he has become a substantially better developer as a result of working in a variety of programming languages.</p>

              <p class='about'>
                <p>Many years ago, Jeff, “El Jefe”, “Danger”, “Not afraid of blameless postmortems”, Koenig began experimenting with a long hollow fish fry that had an explosive mixture of sodium, Jenkins, and broken tests.
                He put this device on an inclined board and aimed it at his pool. Then he poured hydrochloric coffee with paint chips in it; and the whole thing shaved yaks for ten minutes.</p>
                
                <p>When he regained consciousness, Jeff said: "Yoinks!", packed up his flannel shirts, and moved to Pittsburgh; where he became the QA Manager at Think Through Math. Since then, Jeff has used his particular set of skills (TM)  to establish testing awesomeness at TTM; which has resulted in a team who collectively owns quality and who deliver high quality software to eager students daily.</p>
                
                <p>When not laying down sweet, sweet testing code; or building smelly rockets, Jeff can be found at <a href="https://github.com/el-jefe-">https://github.com/el-jefe-</a> on GitHub; and <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffkoenig">@jeffkoenig</a> on Twitter.</p>

              <p class='abstract'>
                <p>So you want to ship software fast? AND you want some confidence that what you are shipping is high quality? Then you need to start doing automated testing, NOW; no excuses. Seriously, what are you waiting for?</p>
                
                <p>Automation is cheap, fast, repeatable and accurate– not to mention way more fun than repetition.</p>
                
                <p>In this talk Jeff Koenig will discuss the advantages of automated tests, some basics about what automated tests should be, and what they should NOT be. He'll also dive into why and how automation and continuous integration should be part of your organization's culture.</p>
