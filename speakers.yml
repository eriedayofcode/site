  talk_title: How to Start Contributing to Open Source
  abstract: Starting to contribute to open source can be overwhelming. The tips in this workshop will help you find a path to contributing with less anxiety and confusion. Not sure what project to contribute to? Examine the OSS projects you use for recent activity, small open issues, and friendly maintainers. Not sure what to work on? Documentation, tests, and bug triaging are important contributions to open source that are much appreciated, often overlooked, and usually smaller in scope than a code change. Learn about Pull Request etiquette, what happens after you send in your work, and what it's like in a maintainer's shoes to take the mystery out of the process. Help make the open source world a better place!
