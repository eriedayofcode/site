  %section.attend-professional
    %h2 As a Professional why should I attend?

    %p
      Working with code day in and day out is a fun and intensive undertaking. There are always new tools, languages, or patterns
      to help make your job easier, but it's often hard to keep up or sift through the tools and concepts to find the best of bunch.
      Erie Day of Code gives you a chance to see several talks and participate in workshops to check out some new technology or
      concepts, allows you to connect with peers, both local and regional, and will help you see more of the Erie development community.
      It's just not so easy for us developers to find each other sometimes! Come connect with peers over an included lunch, learn some new things, and meet some new friends.


  %section.attend-student
    %h2 As a Student why should I attend?

    %p
      No matter what year you're in currently at college (or even high school), this event is sure to teach you a whole lot about
      real world development tools and strategies.  Along with numerous talks and hands on workshops, you'll have a chance to connect
      with other students in the area and developers of all levels of experience.  You'll be able to get a peek inside their day-to-day
      tasks, ask them questions about how to get started, and make some new contacts with potential employers.  Take the opporunity to
      sign up for our monthly Ruby user group to stay connected and continue learning modern day concepts and practical application
      while you continue learning all the important theory in your Computer Science or Software Engineering curriculum.  You'll be able
      to draw connections between the material and applying it easier by seeing it used hands on by your peers.

  %section.attend-nondev
    %h2 As someone who isn't a developer why should I attend?

    %p
      Whether you're a project manager, content writer, graphic designer, employer, operations engineer, creative, or just someone considering picking up
      programming as a hobby, this event can offer you something.  You'll have a chance to connect with many different regional developers
      to learn a bit about the development world and see what their day-to-day jobs are like.  You'll get a look into how open source keeps
      the web and software in general pressing forward, understand some new development practices, and get a better grasp on what programming
      entails for the web.
